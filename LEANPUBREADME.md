This a book on constructing ebooks using Markdown. No esoteric and complicated formats. No WYSIWYG editors. No PDF hell. Just plaintext. 

You'll learn everything from generating a TOC to adding cover images.

It'll teach you the very workflow I used to write this book. A workflow that frees you from the constraints
of writing in a complicated format that scarcely resembles text, or writing 

## You'll learn the following;

- The differences between various Markdown implementations
- How to take Markdown and turn it into;
  - epub
  - mobi
  - pdf
  - html
- How to work with code samples, codeblocks, images, TOC etc
- How to build custom Markdown extensions using Kramdown. For stuff like;
  - code bubbles
  - notes
  - asides 
  - and other nifty little doodads
- How various html ebook format wrappers (such as ePub, mobi etc) work. No magic!
- Common markdown pitfalls (I documented all my failures while writing this book)
- Various techniques for previewing your Markdown output 
  - Sublime Text Previewing
  - html previews
  - automatic previews using the guard gem
- How to mirror the Leanpub workflow using local tools
- How to customize converters so you have full control of your in-between formats; laTeX (pdf) and HTML (ePub, mobi etc)
- The minimal laTeX you'll need to get stuff done with PDF

## What you need to know

Some hacker skills are necessary to make full use of this book. To write books using Markdown you'll need to be
comfortable getting your hands dirty, breaking things and learning. This book doesn't assume 
you're skilled in any particular language but it assumes you are skilled in programming. Familiarity with your systems 
package manager will be necessary.

Can you do this?
    $ homebrew install

Or if you are on Linux this?
    $ sudo apt-get install

If this leaves you scratching your head then you are not ready for this book. If you are left feeling
comfortable and at ease, not queasy and fearful, then you are ready.

Some rudimentary ability to read and edit Ruby will be necessary. If you are comfortable enough to edit Gemfiles and
install gems using bundler then you should be fine.

more permissively licensed the more valuable it becomes. The more free my work is to move the greater the potential 
impact it can have.

My goal is to make the book as valuable to you as possible. So the less I limit you the better.
